This folder contents aim to try map integration of different crime related police stations.
1. Folder 'using Constants.js' - The script.js CAN BE RUN ON LOCAL MACHINE - no sql or csv is required here. 'constants.js' is being used here.
2. Folder 'using SQL' - The script.js here CAN BE USED WITH SQL Table named 'crime_data'.
3. Folder 'using CSV' - The script.js here CAN BE USED WITH CSV file -> FOR USING 'require', WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE THIS CODE IN NODEJS AND DO THE SETUP ACCORDINGLY
